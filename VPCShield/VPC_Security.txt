AWS VPC Project Complete! 
----------------
Dive into my journey of creating a VPC with advanced security configurations on AWS. Here's a quick breakdown of what I achieved:

 *VPC Creation* 

Created a custom VPC with CIDR block
Set up subnets and attached an Internet Gateway for internet access.
 
 *EC2 Setup* 

Launched EC2 instances with optimal configurations.
Configured storage and security for Jenkins deployment.

 *Security Configurations* 

Managed instance-level security using Security Groups (SSH, HTTP, Jenkins ports).
Implemented NACLs for subnet traffic control and security testing.

 *Overcoming Security Challenges* 
Successfully tested access control using NACLs by denying all inbound traffic, ensuring robust protection from unauthorized access.

 *Takeaway* 
This project has been a fantastic learning experience, giving me deep insights into AWS cloud security architecture and multi-layer protection.
